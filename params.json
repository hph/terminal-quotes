{"name":"Terminal Quotes","tagline":"This program was written as a replacement for Linux Mint's \"Fortune Cookies\". It prints a quote every time the terminal is opened. More quotes can easily be added.","google":"","body":"Setup\r\n-----\r\n### Manual install (Linux)\r\nExecute the following commands (just copy and paste):\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/haukurpallh/terminal-quotes.git\r\n    mv terminal-quotes ~/.termquotes\r\n    echo python /home/$USER/.termquotes/termquotes.py >> ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\nAdding more quotes\r\n------------------\r\nThe procedure to add quotes is fairly simple. For example, open `general.txt`\r\nand enter the following lines:\r\n\r\n    [William Shakespeare]\r\n    To be or not to be: that is the question.\r\n\r\nThere can be no empty lines between the line containing the name of the author\r\nand the quotes and there has to be an empty line between an author's last quote\r\nand the next author's header ([William Shakespeare] in this case). Also, the\r\nlast line of the file has to be empty. Different quotes from the same author\r\nare separated with `&` as in the following example:\r\n\r\n    [William Shakespeare]\r\n    Even you, Brutus?\r\n    &\r\n    To be or not to be: that is the question.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nEvery time you open a new terminal the program will print a quote. If you\r\nalso want to be able to print a quote whenever you want, execute the following\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n    echo alias q=\"python /home/$USER/.termquotes/termquotes.py >> ~/.baschrc\"\r\n\r\nNow enter the `q` command to get a random quote.\r\n\r\nComing soon\r\n-----------\r\n* Download quotes from various sites with one command.\r\n* Improve code so that quotes with empty lines can be added.\r\n* Layout settings and color.\r\n* Automatic version checker.","note":"Don't delete this file!
