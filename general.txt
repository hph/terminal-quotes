[Carl Sagan]
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
&
If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,
you must first invent the universe.
&
The universe seems neither benign nor hostile,
merely indifferent to the concerns of such
puny creatures as we are.
&
The surface of the Earth is the shore of the
cosmic ocean. Recently we've waded a little out,
maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting.
&
To live in the hearts of those we
leave behind is to live forever.
&
But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at
does not imply that all who are laughed at are
geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed
at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright Brothers.
But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown. 
&
It is far better to grasp the universe as it
really is than to persist in delusion,
however satisfying and reassuring. 
&
Science is a way of thinking much more
than it is a body of knowledge. 
&
We have also arranged things so that almost
no one understands science and technology.
This is a prescription for disaster. We might
get away with it for a while, but sooner or
later this combustible mixture of ignorance
and power is going to blow up in our faces.
&
We live in a society exquisitely dependent on
science and technology, in which hardly anyone
knows anything about science and technology. 
&
Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant
planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away
in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there
are far more galaxies than people.

[Christopher Hitchens]
If you gave (Jerry) Falwell an enema
you could bury him in a matchbox.
&
Atheists have always argued that this
world is all that we have, and that
our duty is to one another to make
the very most and best of it.
&
... up with which I will not put.
&
[George W. Bush] is lucky to be governor of Texas.
He is unusually incurious, abnormally unintelligent,
amazingly inarticulate, fantastically uncultured,
extraordinarily uneducated, and apparently
quite proud of all these things.
&
Forgotten were the elementary rules of logic,
that extraordinary claims require extraordinary
evidence and that what can be asserted without
evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.
&
I became a journalist because I did not want
to rely on newspapers for information.
&
Faith is the surrender of the mind; it's the
surrender of reason, it's the surrender of the
only thing that makes us different from other
mammals. It's our need to believe, and to
surrender our skepticism and our reason, our
yearning to discard that and put all our trust
or faith in someone or something, that is the
sinister thing to me. Of all the supposed
virtues, faith must be the most overrated.
&
It [Obama's Nobel peace prize] would be like
giving someone an Oscar in the hope that it would
encourage them to make a decent motion picture.
&
If Jesus could heal a blind person he happened
to meet, then why not heal blindness?
&
I shall simply say that those who offer false
consolation are false friends.

[Oscar Wilde]
A gentleman is one who never hurts
anyone's feelings unintentionally.
&
Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
&
All art is quite useless.
&
An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy
of being called an idea at all.

[Friedrich Nietzsche]
A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum
shows that faith does not prove anything.
&
Ah, women. They make the highs higher and
the lows more frequent.
&
You have your way. I have my way. As for
the right way, the correct way, and the
only way, it does not exist.
&
That which does not kill me only makes me stronger.
&
The lie is a condition of life.
&
A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes
sufficed to cure a person in love.
&
After coming into contact with a religious
man I always feel I must wash my hands.
&
All credibility, all good conscience,
all evidence of truth come only from the senses.
&
And if you gaze for long into an abyss,
the abyss gazes also into you.
&
Before the effect one believes in different
causes than one does after the effect.
&
Character is determined more by the lack of
certain experiences than by those one has had.
&
Faith is not wanting to know what is true.
&
He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.
&
He who laughs best today, will also laugh last.
&
He who would learn to fly one day must first
learn to stand and walk and run and climb
and dance; one cannot fly into flying.
&
Hope in reality is the worst of all evils
because it prolongs the torments of man.
&
In every real man a child is hidden that wants to play.
&
In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups,
parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.
&
In the course of history, men come to see that
iron necessity is neither iron nor necessary.
&
Is life not a thousand times too short
for us to bore ourselves? 
&
Which is it, is man one of God's blunders
or is God one of man's?
&
It is always consoling to think of suicide:
in that way one gets through many a bad night.
&
It is my ambition to say in ten sentences
what others say in a whole book, what everyone
else does not say in a whole book.
&
Mystical explanations are thought to be deep;
the truth is that they are not even shallow.
&
Many a man fails as an original thinker
simply because his memory it too good.
&
Not when truth is dirty, but when it is shallow, does
the enlightened man dislike to wade into its waters.
&
One must still have chaos in oneself to be
able to give birth to a dancing star.
&
Our treasure lies in the beehive of our knowledge.
We are perpetually on the way thither, being by nature
winged insects and honey gatherers of the mind.
&
People who have given us their complete confidence
believe that they have a right to ours.
The inference is false, a gift confers no rights.
&
The Christian resolution to find the world ugly
and bad has made the world ugly and bad.
&
The doer alone learneth.
&
The most common lie is that which one lies to himself;
lying to others is relatively an exception.
&
The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct
him to hold in higher esteemthose who think
alike than those who think differently.
&
There are horrible people who, instead of solving
a problem, tangle it up and make it harder to solve
for anyone who wants to deal with it. Whoever does
not know how to hit the nail on the head should be
asked not to hit it at all.
&
There are no facts, only interpretations.
&
There are no moral phenomena at all,
but only a moral interpretation of phenomena.
&
To live is to suffer, to survive is to find
some meaning in the suffering.
&
When marrying, ask yourself this question:
Do you believe that you will be able to converse
well with this person into your old age?
Everything else in marriage is transitory.
&
When one has finished building one's house,
one suddenly realizes that in the process one
has learned something that one really needed
to know in the worst way - before one began.
&
Whenever I climb I am followed by a dog called 'Ego'. 
&
Whoever battles with monsters had better see
that it does not turn him into a monster.
And if you gaze long into an abyss,
the abyss will gaze back into you.
&
Woman was God's second mistake.
&
Women are considered deep - why? Because
one can never discover any bottom to them.
Women are not even shallow.
&
Words are but symbols for the relations of
things to one another and to us; nowhere
do they touch upon absolute truth. 
&
To those human beings who are of any concern
to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness,
ill-treatment, indignities - I wish that they
should not remain unfamiliar with profound
self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust,
the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no
pity for them, because I wish them the only
thing that can prove today whether one is
worth anything or not - that one endures. 
&
I am not a man; I am dynamite!
Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must
be a sea to be able to receive a polluted
stream without becoming unclean.

[H. L. Mencken]
A cynic is a man who, when he smells flowers,
looks around for coffins.
&
A church is a place in which gentlemen
who have never been to heaven brag about
it to persons who will never get there.
&
A good politician is quite as unthinkable
as an honest burglar.
&
A politician is an animal which can sit on a
fence and yet keep both ears to the ground.
&
All men are frauds. The only difference between
them is that some admit it. I myself deny it.
&
An idealist is one who, on noticing that roses
smell better than a cabbage, concludes that
it will also make better soup.
&
Before a man speaks it is always safe to assume
that he is a fool. After he speaks,
it is seldom necessary to assume it.
&
Conscience is the inner voice that warns us
that someone might be looking.
&
Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical
belief in the occurrence of the improbable.
&
Every man sees in his relatives, and especially in his
cousins, a series of grotesque caricatures of himself.
&
It doesn't take a majority to make a rebellion;
it takes only a few determined leaders and a sound cause.
&
It is hard to believe that a man is telling
the truth when you know that you would lie
if you were in his place.
&
It is inaccurate to say that I hate everything.
I am strongly in favor of common sense, common
honesty, and common decency. This makes me
forever ineligible for public office.
&
Legend: A lie that has attained the dignity of age.
&
Men have a much better time of it than women.
For one thing, they marry later;
for another thing, they die earlier.
&
Most people want security in this world, not liberty.
&
Poetry has done enough when it charms,
but prose must also convince.
&
Temptation is an irresistible force at work
on a movable body.
&
The basic fact about human existence is not
that it is a tragedy, but that it is a bore.
It is not so much a war as an endless standing in line.
&
The older I grow the more I distrust the
familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom.
&
We are here and it is now. Further than that,
all human knowledge is moonshine.

[C. A. R. Hoare]
We should forget about small efficiencies,
say about 97% of the time: premature
optimization is the root of all evil.

[Douglas Hofstadter]
Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer
than you expect, even when you take into
account Hofstadter's Law.

[Jamie Zawinski]
Some people, when confronted with a
problem, think "I know, I'll use regular
expressions." Now they have two problems.

[Brian Kernighan]
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the
code in the first place. Therefore, if
you write code as cleverly as possible,
you are, by definition, not smart enough
to debug it.

[Bill Gates]
Measuring programming progress by lines
of code is like measuring aircraft
building progress by weight.

[Rick Osborne]
Always code as if the guy who ends up
maintaining your code will be a violent
psychopath who knows where you live.

[Yoggi Berra]
In theory, theory and practice are the
same. In practice, they're not.

[Albert Einstein]
Two things are infinite: the universe
and human stupidity; and I'm not sure
about the universe.
&
Compound interest is the eighth wonder
of the world. He who understands it,
earns it, he who doesn't, pays it.
&
The most incomprehensible thing about the
world is that it's comprehensible.
&
Great spirits have always encountered
violent opposition from mediocrities.
&
The latter cannot understand it when a
man does not thoughtlessly submit to
hereditary prejudices but honestly and
courageously uses his intelligence.
&
Everything should be made as simple as
possible, but not simpler.
&
Common sense is the collection of
prejudices acquired by age eighteen.
&
The only thing that interferes with my
learning is my education.
&
I know not with what weapons World War
III will be fought, but World War IV will
be fought with sticks and stones.
&
The fear of death is one of the most
unjustified of all fears, for there's
no risk of accident for someone who's
dead.
&
The most beautiful thing we can
experience is the mysterious. It is the
source of all true art and all science.
He to whom this emotion is a stranger,
who can no longer pause to wonder and
stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead:
his eyes are closed.
&
A man's ethical behaviour should be
based effectually on sympathy,
education, and social ties; no religious
basis is necessary. Man would indeed be
in a poor way if he had to be restrained
by fear of punishment and hope of reward
after death.
&
Now he has departed from this strange
world a little ahead of me. That means
nothing. People like us, who believe in
physics, know that the distinction
between past, present, and future is only
a stubbornly persistent illusion.
&
I came — though the child of entirely
irreligious (Jewish) parents — to a deep
religiousness, which, however, reached an
abrupt end at the age of twelve. Through
the reading of popular scientific books I
soon reached the conviction that much in
the stories of the Bible could not be
true. The consequence was a positively
fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with
the impression that youth is
intentionally being deceived by the state
through lies; it was a crushing impression.
&
It was, of course, a lie what you read
about my religious convictions, a lie
which is being systematically repeated. I
do not believe in a personal God and I
have never denied this but have expressed
it clearly. If something is in me which
can be called religious then it is the
unbounded admiration for the structure of
the world so far as our science can reveal
it.
&
Honestly, I cannot understand what people mean
when they talk about the freedom of the human will.
I have a feeling, for instance, that I will something
or other; but what relation this has with freedom I
cannot understand at all. I feel that I will to light
my pipe and I do it; but how can I connect this up
with the idea of freedom? What is behind the act of
willing to light the pipe? Another act of willing?
Schopenhauer once said: Man can do what he will but
he cannot will what he wills).

[Lawrence Krauss]
The amazing thing is that every atom in
your body came from a star that exploded.
And, the atoms in your left hand probably
came from a different star than your right
hand. It really is the most poetic thing I
know about physics: You are all stardust.
You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t
exploded, because the elements - the
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the
things that matter for evolution - weren’t
created at the beginning of time. They
were created in the nuclear furnaces of
stars, and the only way they could get
into your body is if those stars were kind
enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The
stars died so that you could be here today.

[Douglas Adams]
In the beginning the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry
and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

[Benjamin Franklin]
The way to see by faith is to shut the eye
of reason: the morning daylight appears
plainer when you put out your candle.
